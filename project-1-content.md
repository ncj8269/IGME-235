        ##Gameplay
        <blockquote>The player has to click on buttons before they disappear to score points.<br>
            Depending on the color of the button they click, they can recieve different point values, <br>
            buffs or negative effects. The controls will be primarily mouse based, but have <br>
            some keyboard inputs to pause or quit game. The player needs to improve on their visual <br>
            and physical response time to get the best score.
